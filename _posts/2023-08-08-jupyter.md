Run Perl incrementally from an Emacs Org file
using `Devel::IPerl` and `emacs-jupyter`, following the steps below.

[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is a very popular editor with a long history, going back
to 1976. It is an *extensible, customizable, self-documenting
real-time display editor,* It has tools for compiling, running and
debuging programs, is a file manager, a news and email reader, etc. It
is written in *emacs-lisp* and includes a lisp interpreter, so it is
easily extended. [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is
a notebook system that allows editing notes intermixed with program
fragments written in one of several several languages, running them
and examining the results, exporting them in several formats, and all
from a web interface. [Perl](https://www.perl.org/about.html) is a very expressive, highly capable,
feature-rich computer language, appropriate for both rapid
prototyping and large scale development
projects. [Org mode](https://orgmode.org/) is an Emacs mode for keeping and organizing notes,
authoring documents, computational notebooks, literate programming,
maintaining to-do lists, planning projects, and more, in a fast and
effective plain text system. It allows intermixing text with computer
codes in many languages, and allows running the codes and displaying
their results, including graphics and tables. Org files may be exported
to a large number of formats,
such as publication ready latex and pdf documents, markdown, html,
plain text, etc. It may seem similiar to Jupyter, but it is more
general purpose than development of code, it runs within a
very mature and powerful editor, and it allows mixing codes of different
languages in the same document. In particular, loading the language
package [ob-perl](https://github.com/NotBrianZach/emacsPackages/blob/master/org-plus-contrib-20181210/ob-perl.el) allows Org files to contain and run Perl codes. Nevertheless, Perl
code sections have to be self-contained in order to be run, or program
fragments that may be joined
into a full program by `tangling` or by using the *literate
programing* tool  `noweb` before they are run. They may not be run and tested
incrementally, as other languages can. I had been thinking of
modifying `ob-perl` to allow running Perl interactive *sessions* from an Org
file. Nevertheless, I found that Zakariyya Mughal has developed a
package [Devel::IPerl](https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::IPerl) with a Perl language kernel and an interface to Jupyter, allowing
interactive Perl sessions to be run within Jupyter. I also found an
emacs package [jupyter](https://github.com/emacs-jupyter/jupyter) that allows running jupyter sessions from Org
code blocks. With these tools I can now run Perl program fragments
interactively from within an Org session through a Jupyter session.

The steps to accomplish this were:

1.  Install `Jupyter` from the package manager. My system is *Debian*
    so I used `apt`:

        sudo apt install jupyter
2.  Install `Devel::IPerl` from CPAN. I manage my Perl installation
    through `perlbrew` and `cpanm`:

        cpanm Devel::IPerl
3.  Install `ob-async` from the emacs package manager, running
    `package-list-packages`, looking for `ob-async`, marking it for
    installation and executing the marked actions, using the `Package`
    menu.
4.  Similarly, install `jupyter` from the emacs package manager.
5.  Add some lines to the `.emacs` initialization file:

        ;; load ob-async to execute code asynchronously
        (require 'ob-async)
        ; jupyter has its own async
        (setq ob-async-no-async-languages-alist '("jupyter-python" "jupyter-perl"))
6.  I believe those lines should go before loading the babel languages.

        (org-babel-do-load-languages
         'org-babel-load-languages
         '(
           ...  ; All your previous previous values
           (jupyter . t) ; add jupyter
           ))
7.  Restart Emacs (or run the *elisp* codes above from a running Emacs).
8.  Then from an org file I can do things like the following:

        #+begin_src jupyter-perl :session ip :exports both :results output
        use v5.36;
        my $x=1;
        say $x;
        #+end_src

    This is rendered as follows when exported:

        use v5.36;
        my $x=1;
        say $x;

    I can run the code with the key sequence `C-cC-c` with *point* (the
    cursor) anyplace within the code block. The result is

        1

    Now I can add a second block and run it:

        $x*=2;  # modify a variable declared in another block
        say $x;

    Results:

        2

    Notice that when I ran the second code block, the value of the
    lexical variable `$x` was
    already known. I can modify it again:

        $x*=3;  # modify again a variable declared in another block
        say $x;

    Results:

        6

    I can add to the `#+begin_src`
    lines of the three blocks above a header argument such as `:tangle program.pl`, so when
    I run tangle `C-c C-v t` the three are combined into a single monolithic
    program and saved in a file `program.pl`. Furthermore, if I add the
    header `:shebang #!/usr/bin/env perl` the file will have
    `#!/usr/bin/env perl` as its first line and it will have the
    executable bit turned on. Then I can run the program with code as:

        #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both :cache yes
        ./program.pl
        #+end_src

    rendered as

        ./program.pl

    Results:

        1
        2
        6

    I can add `:async yes` to the header arguments in order to run the
    code block in a non-blocking mode and continue editing without
    waiting for the result, as in

        #+begin_src jupyter-perl :session ip :exports both :results output :async yes
        say expensive_calculation();
        sub expensive_calculation(){
            sleep(10); # fake the effort for 10s
            return 42; # what else?
        }
        #+end_src

    rendered as:

        say expensive_calculation();
         sub expensive_calculation(){
             sleep(10); # fake the effort
             return 42; # what else?
         }

    The result is

        5f03a87f-62c0-49da-8a7b-6204caa490b9

    for ten seconds, while I may continue editing, and then it becomes
    the actual result

        42

    I may run graphical programs as:

        use PDL;
        use PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot;
        my $t=zeroes(100)->xlinvals(0,24);
        gplot(with=>"lines", $t, $t->sin, with=>"lines", $t, $t->cos);

    From the gnuplot window I can save the plot, or I can set the
    gnuplot terminal to some file, say `filename.png`, and insert the graphics into the Org
    file with the code

        [[./filename.png]]

    Results:

I hope I didn't forget any steps and that it work for others.

Thanks to Zakariyya Mughal, author of `Devel::IPerl`, for his advice
and his work.
