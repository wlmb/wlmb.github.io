*Photonic* is a Perl package, using *Moo* and *PDL*, for the
calculation of the optical properties of metamaterials and photonic
crystals. I gave a talk [(here)](../../../../assets/pdf/20241104Photonic.pdf) and presented some examples ([here](../../../../assets/pdf/20241104Example.pdf)) at
the Science Track of the London Perl and Raku Workshop 2024,
[(announcement)](https://www.perl.com/article/announcing-the-london-perl-raku-workshop-2024-lpw/) October 26.
