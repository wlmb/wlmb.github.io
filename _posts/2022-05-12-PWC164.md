# Task 1: Prime Palindrome

    Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
    Write a script to find all prime numbers less than 1000, which
    are also palindromes in base 10. Palindromic numbers are
    numbers whose digits are the same in reverse. For example, 313
    is a palindromic prime, but 337 is not, even though 733 (337
    reversed) is also prime.

I guess one can generate primes and filter palindromes or the
other way around. The former is straightforward:

    perl -MMath::Prime::Util=primes -E 'say "Output: ", join ", ", grep {$_ eq reverse} @{primes(1000)}'

Results:

    Output: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 101, 131, 151, 181, 191, 313, 353, 373, 383, 727, 757, 787, 797, 919, 929

I can check with the script included with `Math::Prime::Util`:

    primes.pl --palindr 1000|perl -E '$/=""; say "Output: ",join ", ", split "\n", <>'

Results:

    Output: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 101, 131, 151, 181, 191, 313, 353, 373, 383, 727, 757, 787, 797, 919, 929

    5  use v5.12;
    6  use warnings;
    7  use Math::Prime::Util qw(primes);
    8  say "Output: ", join ", ", grep {$_ eq reverse} @{primes(1000)};

Run the code:

    ./ch-1.pl

Results:

    Output: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 101, 131, 151, 181, 191, 313, 353, 373, 383, 727, 757, 787, 797, 919, 929

Some variations could include allowing the user to set the
range of numbers to test and the base (what's so special about
10?).


# Task 2: Happy Numbers

    Submitted by: Robert DiCicco
    Write a script to find the first 8 Happy Numbers in
    base 10. For more information, please check out Wikipedia.

    Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the
    sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until
    the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops
    endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.

    Those numbers for which this process end in 1 are happy
    numbers, while those numbers that do not end in 1 are unhappy
    numbers.

    Example
    19 is Happy Number in base 10, as shown:

    19 => 1^2 + 9^2
       => 1   + 81
       => 82 => 8^2 + 2^2
             => 64  + 4
             => 68 => 6^2 + 8^2
                   => 36  + 64
                   => 100 => 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2
                          => 1 + 0 + 0
                          => 1

I test each integer in sequence for happiness until I get 8 of them. To that
end, I map integers to the sum of the squares of their digits
and keep an array of seen numbers to detect cycles to finish
the search. If I finish with a 1, I've found a happy number.

    perl -MList::Util=sum -E '$n=0; for(1..8){while(1){ say($n),last if h(++$n)}}
    sub h {$x=shift; my %s; while(!$s{$x}){$s{$x}=1;$x=sum map {$_*$_} split "", $x} return $x==1;}'

Results:

    1
    7
    10
    13
    19
    23
    28
    31

     5  use v5.12;
     6  use warnings;
     7  use List::Util qw(sum);
     8  my $desired=8;
     9  my $try=1;
    10  my @found=();
    11  while(@found<$desired){
    12      push @found,  $try if happy($try);
    13      ++$try;
    14  }
    15  say "The first $desired happy numbers are: ", join " ", @found;
    16
    17  sub happy {
    18      my $x=shift;
    19      my %seen;
    20      while(!$seen{$x}){
    21          $seen{$x}=1;
    22          $x=sum map {$_*$_} split "", $x
    23      }
    24      return $x==1;
    25  }

Use:

    ./ch-2.pl

Results:

    The first 8 happy numbers are: 1 7 10 13 19 23 28 31

Variations could include allowing the user to set the hapiness desired and
the base to use.
