We generalize the Drude plasma frequency in terms of a tensor which we
write in terms of integrals of the convective flux over the Fermi
surface. We find an efficient computational scheme for its calculation
and we apply it to noble metals under isotropic and anisotropic
strain. The manuscript is in the [arXiv:2011.04849](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04849). The paper was
published in [JOSAB](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAB.416741).
