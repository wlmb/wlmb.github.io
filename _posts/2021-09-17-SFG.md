We uploaded to [the arxiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06501) a manuscript about three wave mixing optical
processes (sum frequency generation, difference frequency generation,
second harmonic generation, optical rectification) in nanowires made
of centrosymmetric materials but with a slightly non-centrosymmetrical
geometry. Centrosymmetry suppresses these processes, but the geometry
restores them. The paper was just published in the
[Physical Review B](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.104.115419).
