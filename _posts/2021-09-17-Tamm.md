We made some notes while familarizing myself with Tamm modes,
electromagnetic surface modes that exist at the interface of periodic
systems. We develop the teory for the modes at the interface between a
periodic superlattice and a homogeneous system, implemented it in `Perl`
and `PDL` and tested the code on the interface between a dielectric
superlatice and vacuum. The notes are
[here](/assets/pdf/20210917tamm.pdf).
