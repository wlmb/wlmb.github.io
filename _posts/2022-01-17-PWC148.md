# Task 1: Eban Numbers

    Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
    Write a script to generate all Eban Numbers <= 100.

    An Eban number is a number that has no letter ‘e’ in it when
    the number is spelled in English (American or British).

    Example
    2, 4, 6, 30, 32 are the first 5 Eban numbers.

I guess I only need to write down the numbers and check their
spelling. It wouldn't be difficult to enumerate all numbers up
to 100, but I found in `CPAN` a module `Lingua::EN::Numbers`
that has a function `num2en` that translates numbers
to English words. With it, the problem becomes extremely simple:

    perl -MLingua::EN::Numbers=num2en -E '
    for(0..@ARGV[0]//100){say "$_ ",num2en($_)  unless ($n=num2en($_))=~/e/}'

Results:

    2 two
    4 four
    6 six
    30 thirty
    32 thirty-two
    34 thirty-four
    36 thirty-six
    40 forty
    42 forty-two
    44 forty-four
    46 forty-six
    50 fifty
    52 fifty-two
    54 fifty-four
    56 fifty-six
    60 sixty
    62 sixty-two
    64 sixty-four
    66 sixty-six

Curiously, there are large gaps, so if I want to get a EBAN
number larger than 66 I have to go up to 2000!

    perl -MLingua::EN::Numbers=num2en -E '
    for(0..$ARGV[0]){say "$_ ",num2en($_)  unless ($n=num2en($_))=~/e/}' 4000

Results:

    2 two
    4 four
    6 six
    30 thirty
    32 thirty-two
    34 thirty-four
    36 thirty-six
    40 forty
    42 forty-two
    44 forty-four
    46 forty-six
    50 fifty
    52 fifty-two
    54 fifty-four
    56 fifty-six
    60 sixty
    62 sixty-two
    64 sixty-four
    66 sixty-six
    2000 two thousand
    2002 two thousand and two
    2004 two thousand and four
    2006 two thousand and six
    2030 two thousand and thirty
    2032 two thousand and thirty-two
    2034 two thousand and thirty-four
    2036 two thousand and thirty-six
    2040 two thousand and forty
    2042 two thousand and forty-two
    2044 two thousand and forty-four
    2046 two thousand and forty-six
    2050 two thousand and fifty
    2052 two thousand and fifty-two
    2054 two thousand and fifty-four
    2056 two thousand and fifty-six
    2060 two thousand and sixty
    2062 two thousand and sixty-two
    2064 two thousand and sixty-four
    2066 two thousand and sixty-six
    4000 four thousand

# Task 2: Cardano Triplets

    Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
    Write a script to generate first 5 Cardano Triplets.

    A triplet of positive integers (a,b,c) is called a Cardano
    Triplet if it satisfies the below condition.

    (a+b c**(1/2))**(1/3)+(a-b c**(1/2))**(1/3)=1

    Example
    (2,1,5) is the first Cardano Triplets.

As it is, this equation has square roots and cubic roots which
may not be integer, but we can get rid of them by manipulating
the equation. Taking its third power we obtain
*2a+3(a<sup>2</sup>-b<sup>2</sup> c)<sup>1/3</sup>=1*.
Isolating the third power and taking the third power of the
resulting equation, it becomes
*27(a<sup>2</sup>-b<sup>2</sup> c)=(1-2a)<sup>3</sup>*.
Finally, expanding and collecting terms it becomes
*8a<sup>3</sup>+15a<sup>2</sup>+6a-27b<sup>2</sup>c-1=0*.
In this form, the task can be solved with a simple PDL oneliner

    perl -MPDL -MPDL::NiceSlice -E '$c=($b=($a=sequence(long,100))->(*1))->(*1);
    $k=8*$a*$a*$a+15*$a*$a+6*$a-27*$b*$b*$c-1; say whichND(!$k)->(:,0:4)'

I build a cube of numbers *k(a,b,c)=8 a<sup>3</sup> + 15a<sup>2</sup> + 6a -27b<sup>2</sup> c-1*
where the indices are taken from the same sequence using
different sets of dummy indices (1 and 2 for *a*, 0 and 2 for
*b*, and 0 and 1 for *c*, some of which are intrinsically
assigned). The call `whichND(!$k)` then returns the indices
*a,b,c* for which the value of *k* is zero.

Results:


    [
     [ 2  1  5]
     [17 18  5]
     [47 80  5]
     [ 5  2 13]
     [44 45 13]
    ]

    22  $how_many=$found if $how_many>$found;
    23  say "The first $how_many Cardano triplets are\n", $r(:,0:$how_many-1) if $how_many>0;

Example:

    ./ch-2.pl

Results:

    [
     [ 2  1  5]
     [17 18  5]
     [47 80  5]
     [ 5  2 13]
     [44 45 13]
    ]

Let's get some more:

    ./ch-2.pl -howmany 30

Results:

    Not enough candidates, please increase upper bound
    The first 22 Cardano triplets are

    [
     [ 2  1  5]
     [17 18  5]
     [47 80  5]
     [ 5  2 13]
     [44 45 13]
     [17  9 20]
     [47 40 20]
     [ 8  3 21]
     [71 72 21]
     [11  4 29]
     [98 99 29]
     [14  5 37]
     [17  6 45]
     [ 5  1 52]
     [20  7 53]
     [23  8 61]
     [26  9 69]
     [29 10 77]
     [47 20 80]
     [71 36 84]
     [32 11 85]
     [35 12 93]
    ]

As I didn't get all 30 numbers, I increase the upper bound:

    ./ch-2.pl -howmany 30 -upperbound 200

Results:

    The first 30 Cardano triplets are

    [
     [  2   1   5]
