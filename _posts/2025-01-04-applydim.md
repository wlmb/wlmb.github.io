Many operations in PDL act on the first dimension, so a very common
idiom is

    $pdl->mv($dim,0)->function($some, $extra, $args)->mv(0, $dim);

to move the dimension `$dim` to the front, operate with the
function and the move the dimension back to its original place.
The idea is to hide the `mv` operations and write this as

    $pdl->apply_to(\&function, $dim, $some, $extra, $args);

or

    apply_to($pdl, "function", $dim, $some, $extra, $args);

Similarly

    $pdl->apply_not_to(\&function, $dim, $some, $extra, $args);

moves the dimension to the back.
Besides a number, `$dim` may also be an array reference, such as as
`[$d0, $d1...]`, to move the dimensions `$d0, $d1...` to the
front or to the back instead of just a single dimension.

The package may be found in [Github](https://github.com/wlmb/PDL-ApplyDim) and in  [CPAN](https://metacpan.org/pod/PDL::ApplyDim).
