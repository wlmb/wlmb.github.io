My solutions ([task 1](https://github.com/wlmb/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-100/wlmb/perl/ch-1.pl) and [task 2](https://github.com/wlmb/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-100/wlmb/perl/ch-2.pl)) to the  [The Weekly Challenge - 100](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-100).

*One-liner* without checks. I use a regular expression to extract the
hours, minutes and pm indicator.

    perl -E 'foreach(@ARGV){/^\s*(\d\d?)(:(\d\d?))?(\s*pm)?/i;
              say $1>12? sprintf("%s->%02d:%02d%s",$_,$1-12,$3,"pm")
                  :$4?   sprintf("%s->%02d:%02d%s",$_,$1+12,$3,"")
                  :      sprintf("%s->%02d:%02d%s",$_,$1,$3,"");}'\
             "05:15 pm" "5:15pm" "19:15" "5:15"

Results:

    05:15 pm->17:15
    5:15pm->17:15
    19:15->07:15pm
    5:15->05:15

           Each argument must have the format "hh:mm:ss ampm"
           where the minutes and seconds are optional and

           If ampm is given, the hour should be not greater than 12 nor
           smaller than 1. If not, hour should be smaller than 24.
           Minutes and seconds should be smaller than 60.

Examples 1 and 2:

    ./ch-1.pl "05:15 pm" "19:15"

Results:

    Input:	05:15 pm
    Output:	17:15
    Input:	19:15
    Output:	07:15 pm

Other examples:

    ./ch-1.pl "05:15 am" "05:15" "1 pm" "13" "0:00"

Results:

    Input:	05:15 am
    Output:	05:15
    Input:	05:15
    Output:	05:15 am
    Input:	1 pm
    Output:	13
    Input:	13
    Output:	01 pm
    Input:	0:00
    Output:	12:00 am

One could enumerate all paths recursively and choose the minimum, but
it is unnecesary: If a path is optimum and we split it at some point
into an initial and a final part, the final part should also be
optimum. Thus, we can build the optimal path from the bottom up.
