# Task 1: Pernicious Numbers

    Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
    Write a script to permute first 10 Pernicious Numbers.

    A pernicious number is a positive integer which has prime number of
    ones in its binary representation.

    The first pernicious number is 3 since binary representation of 3 =
    (11) and 1 + 1 = 2, which is a prime.

    Expected Output
    3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

There is a straightforward solution: Convert the number to a binary
string, split its digits, sum them and test their primality. It fits
into a one-liner, using subroutines from `Math::Prime::Util` and from `List::Util`:

    perl -MMath::Prime::Util=is_prime -MList::Util=sum0 -E '
    for(1..10){say($n),next if is_prime(sum0 split "", sprintf "%b", ++$n); redo}'

Results:

    3
    5
    6
    7
    9
    10
    11
    12
    13
    14

    11  my $candidate=0;
    12  my @pernicious;
    13  for(1..$N){
    14      push(@pernicious, $candidate), next
    15          if is_prime(sum0 split "", sprintf "%b", ++$candidate);
    16      redo
    17  }
    18  say "The first $N pernicious numbers are ", join ", ",  @pernicious;

Example:

    ./ch-1.pl
    ./ch-1.pl 20

Results:

    The first 10 pernicious numbers are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
    The first 20 pernicious numbers are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
    17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28


# Task 2: Weird Number

    Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
    You are given number, $n > 0.

    Write a script to find out if the given number is a Weird Number.

    According to Wikipedia, it is defined as:

    The sum of the proper divisors (divisors including 1 but not itself)
    of the number is greater than the number, but no subset of those
    divisors sums to the number itself.

    Example 1:
    Input: $n = 12
    Output: 0

    Since the proper divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which sum to
    16; but 2 + 4 + 6 = 12.
    Example 2:
    Input: $n = 70
    Output: 1

    As the proper divisors of 70 are 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 35; these sum
    to 74, but no subset of these sums to 70.

For any number I can get its `divisors` using the `Math::Prime::Util`
package. I can obtain all its `subsets` using the
`Algorithm::Combinataorics` package and I can `sum0` them using the
`List::Util` package. Thus, there is not much remaining work to do and
the problem may be solved with the following one-liner:

    perl -MMath::Prime::Util=divisors -MAlgorithm::Combinatorics=subsets -MList::Util=sum0 -E '
    M: for $N(@ARGV){@d=divisors($N); pop @d; $O=0, next unless sum0(@d)>$N; @s=subsets(\@d);
    for(@s){$O=0, next M if sum0(@$_)==$N} $O=1;} continue{say "$N ", $O?"is":"is not", " weird"}
    ' 12 70 836 4030

Results:

    12 is not weird
    70 is weird
    836 is weird
    4030 is weird

I used the `continue` mechanism to print the results.

    13   WEIRD:
    14      for my $N(@ARGV){
    15          say("Arguments must be larger than 1"), next unless $N>=2;
    16          my @divisors=divisors($N);
    17          pop @divisors; # keep only proper divisors
    18          $is_weird=0, next WEIRD unless sum0(@divisors)>$N; # Overabundant?
    19          my @subsets=subsets(\@divisors);
    20          for(@subsets){
    21              $is_weird=0, next WEIRD if sum0(@$_)==$N; #Semiperfect, fail
    22          }
    23          $is_weird=1;
    24  } continue {
    25      say "$N ", $is_weird?"is":"is not", " weird";
    26  }

Examples:

    ./ch-2.pl 12 70 836 4030

Results:

    12 is not weird
    70 is weird
    836 is weird
    4030 is weird
