My solutions ([task 1](https://github.com/wlmb/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-120/wlmb/perl/ch-1.pl) and [task 2](https://github.com/wlmb/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-120/wlmb/perl/ch-2.pl) to the  [The Weekly Challenge - 120](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-120).


# Task 1: Swap Odd/Even bits

    Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
    You are given a positive integer $N less than or equal to 255.

    Write a script to swap the odd positioned bit with even
    positioned bit and print the decimal equivalent of the new
    binary representation.

    Example
    Input: $N = 101
    Output: 154

    Binary representation of the given number is 01 10 01 01.
    The new binary representation after the odd/even swap is 10 01
    10 10.
    The decimal equivalent of 10011010 is 154.

    Input: $N = 18
    Output: 33

    Binary representation of the given number is 00 01 00 10.
    The new binary representation after the odd/even swap is 00 10
    00 01.
    The decimal equivalent of 100001 is 33.

I can get the even and odd bits by applying the `&` operator
with masks that have only even or odd bits on: `10101010=>170`
is an 8 bit binary number with all odd bits set (counting
right to left from 0) while `01010101=>85` has all even bits
set. Then I can shift left and right the results and combine
them with `|`. The program is a one liner:

    perl -E 'say "Input: $_, Output: ", ((($_&170)>>1) |(($_&85)<<1)) for @ARGV' 101 18

Results:

    Input: 101, Output: 154
    Input: 18, Output: 33

    use v5.12;
    use List::Util qw(all);
    my $odd=170; # 10101010
    my $even=85; # 01010101

    say "Input: $_, Output: ",
         0<=$_<=255?((($_&$odd)>>1) |(($_&$even)<<1)):"Invalid"
         for @ARGV;

Example:

    ./ch-1.pl 101 18 300


# Task 2: Clock Angle

    Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
    You are given time $T in the format hh:mm.

    Write a script to find the smaller angle formed by the hands
    of an analog clock at a given time.

    HINT: A analog clock is divided up into 12 sectors. One sector
    represents 30 degree (360/12 = 30).

    Example
    Input: $T = '03:10'
    Output: 35 degree

    The distance between the 2 and the 3 on the clock is 30
    degree.
    For the 10 minutes i.e. 1/6 of an hour that have passed.
    The hour hand has also moved 1/6 of the distance between the 3
    and the 4, which adds 5 degree (1/6 of 30).
    The total measure of the angle is 35 degree.

    Input: $T = '04:00'
    Output: 120 degree

The angle moved by the minutes hand is proportional to the
minutes. The angle moved by the hours hand is proportional to
the hour+the fraction of hour corresponding to the minutes. So
the solution to the problem is simply obtained using modular
arithmetic. If the angle is too large, I substract it from a
full turn. This allows a one liner solution.

    perl -E 'for(@ARGV){$_=~m/(\d\d):(\d\d)/ or die; $a=(30*($1+$2/60)-$2*6)%360;\
          say "Input: $_, Output: ", $a>180?360-$a:$a;}' 03:10 04:00

Results:

    Input: 03:10, Output; 35
    Input: 04:00, Output; 120
