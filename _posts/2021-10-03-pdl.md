I recently read about a [benchmark](https://www.fourmilab.ch/fbench/fbench.html) the compares the performances of lots of
languages. The test consists in calculating the properties of an
optical system by tracing some rays, a task that requires the use of
trigonometric functions. Normalizing the results to `C`, it reports that
`Perl` is about 23 times slower. This is not too surprising, as `Perl`
pays in performance for being much more expressive and flexible,
though those attributes are not taken advantage of in this
number crunching example. Nevertheless, there is a system, the
[Perl Data Language](http://pdl.perl.org/), `PDL` ([metacpan.org](https://metacpan.org/pod/PDL), [Scientific computing with
Perl)](https://github.com/PDLPorters/pdl) that extends `Perl` with objects that represent multidimensional
arrays with which it is possible to do number crunching  interfacing
to fast `C` functions, and looping automatically over the dimensions
of the arrays. Using `Perl` with `PDL` one retains the expressive
power of `Perl` without sacrificing speed for number crunching code.

Thus I made a [version](https://github.com/wlmb/floating_point_benchmarks/blob/altperl/src/perl/fbench2.pl) version of the original [perl code](https://github.com/Fourmilab/floating_point_benchmarks/blob/master/src/perl/fbench.pl) using
`PDL`. It turns out my version runs about eight times faster. On the
other hand, [mohawk2](https://github.com/mohawk2) made his own [version](https://github.com/mohawk2/floating_point_benchmarks/blob/perl-tweaks/src/perl/fbench-pdl.pl) using `PDL` and using
its `pp_def` mechanism that allows writing `C`-like functions within
the `Perl` code. His version is comparable in speed to
`C`. Furthermore, simply by setting an environment variable,
`PDL_AUTOPTHREAD_TARG`, the code runs in parallel threads and thus may
become faster than `C`.

The results of my benchmark are summarized below.

Notice that in my system Perl (5.32.1), `Perl` is 42 times slower than
`C`, but with `PDL` it becomes only 5 times slower, and using `pp_def`
it is comparable in speed and parallelizing it may even be faster.
