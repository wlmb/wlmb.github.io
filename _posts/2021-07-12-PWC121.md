# Task 1: Invert Bit

    Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
    You are given integers 0 <= $m <= 255 and 1 <= $n <= 8.

    Write a script to invert $n bit from the end of the binary
    representation of $m and print the decimal representation of
    the new binary number.

    Example
    Input: $m = 12, $n = 3
    Output: 8

    Binary representation of $m = 00001100
    Invert 3rd bit from the end = 00001000
    Decimal equivalent of 00001000 = 8

    Input $m = 18, $n = 4
    Output: 26

    Binary representation of $m = 00010010
    Invert 4th bit from the end = 00011010
    Decimal equivalent of 00011010 = 26

The truth table of the `xor` `(^)` operator is

    | a | b | a ^ b |
    |---+---+-------|
    | 0 | 0 |     0 |
    | 0 | 1 |     1 |
    | 1 | 0 |     1 |
    | 1 | 1 |     0 |

When `a==0` the first two rows show that `a^b==b`, and when
`a=1` the last two rows show that `a^b==!b`. Thus, we can
invert a bit by xoring with a word that has that bit on and
all the rest turned off. This yields a one liner:

    perl -MList::Util=pairs -E 'foreach(pairs @ARGV){($n,$b)=@$_; \
          say "Number: $n, Bit: $b Output: ", (1<<($b-1))^$n;}'  12 3 18 4

Results:

    Number: 12, Bit: 3 Output: 8
    Number: 18, Bit: 4 Output: 26

            unless 0<=$n<=255 && 1<=$b<=8; # ??
        my $r=(1<<($b-1))^$n; # Count bits from 1, not 0
        say "Number: $n, Bit: $b, Output: $r";
    }

Example:

    ./ch-1.pl 12 3 18 4 300 25

Results:

    Number: 12, Bit: 3, Output: 8
    Number: 18, Bit: 4, Output: 26
    Wrong range: 0<=300<=255 && 1<=25<=8?


# Task 2: The Traveling Salesman

    Submitted by: Jorg Sommrey
    You are given a NxN matrix containing the distances between N
    cities.

    Write a script to find a round trip of minimum length visiting
    all N cities exactly once and returning to the start.

    Example
    Matrix: [0, 5, 2, 7]
            [5, 0, 5, 3]
            [3, 1, 0, 6]
            [4, 5, 4, 0]

    Output:
            length = 10
            tour = (0 2 1 3 0)
    BONUS 1: For a given number N, create a random NxN distance
            matrix and find a solution for this matrix.
    BONUS 2: Find a solution for a random matrix of size 15x15 or
            20x20


## Exhaustive search

This is a hard one (for the computer). The *easy* (for the
programmer) solution is
to generate all tours, choosing the shortest
one.

    # Perl weekly challenge 121
    # Task 2: The traveling salesman
    #
    # See https://wlmb.github.io/2021/07/12/PWC121/#task-2-the-traveling-salesman
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use v5.12;
    use PDL; # Perl data language

    foreach(@ARGV){
        #Assume the matrix is of the form [[m00,m01,m02..],[m10,m11,...]...]
        my $M=pdl($_);
        say("Require square matrix"), next unless $M->ndims==2 and $M->dim(0)==$M->dim(1);
        say("Self distances should be null"), next unless all($M->diagonal(0,1)==0);
        my $N=$M->dim(0); # number of cities
        my $iterate=permutator($N);
        my $best_tour;
        my $shortest_length;
        while(my @cities=$iterate->()){ # for each possible trip
    	my $tour=pdl(@cities);
    	my $indices=pdl($tour->rotate(-1), $tour)->transpose; #pair next city to current city
    	my $length=$M->indexND($indices)->sumover; # get distances for this trip and sum
    	($best_tour, $shortest_length)=($tour, $length)
    	    if !defined $shortest_length || $length<$shortest_length;
        }
        $best_tour=append($best_tour,0); #go back to the first city
        say "\nInput $M\nBest tour: $best_tour\nShortest length: $shortest_length";
        say("Strange metric: Length A->B not equal Length B->A")
            unless all $M==$M->transpose;
    }

I recycle the iterator I used for the task 2 of [PWC109](https://wlmb.github.io/2021/04/19/PWC109/) with
some small variations. I arbitrarily choose to start and end
at city number 0.

    sub permutator { #returns an iterator for permutations
        my $n_items=(shift)-1;
        my @items=1..$n_items;
        my $n=0;
        my $done=0;
        sub {
    	return if $done;
    	my $which=$n; #next item to transpose
    	return 0,@items if $n++ == 0; #return first time through
    	my $with_whom=1; #with whom to permute
    	while($with_whom<=$n_items&&$which%$with_whom==0){
    	    $which/=$with_whom;
    	    ++$with_whom;
    	}
    	$done=1, return if $with_whom >$n_items; #no more transpositions
    	$which=$with_whom-$which%$with_whom;
    	#use negative indices to transpose rightmost first
    	@items[-$with_whom+1..-1]=reverse @items[-$with_whom+1..-1]; #reorder
    	@items[-$which,-$with_whom]=@items[-$with_whom,-$which]; # transpose
    	return 0,@items
        }
    }

Examples:

    ./ch-2.pl '[[0, 5, 2, 7],[5, 0, 5, 3],[3, 1, 0, 6],[4, 5, 4, 0]]' \
              '[[0,2,3],[20,0,6],[30,60,0]]'

Results:


    Input
    [
     [0 5 2 7]
     [5 0 5 3]
     [3 1 0 6]
     [4 5 4 0]
    ]

    Best tour: [0 2 1 3 0]
    Shortest length: 10
    Strange: Length A->B not equal Length B->A

    Input
    [
     [ 0  2  3]
     [20  0  6]
     [30 60  0]
    ]

    Best tour: [0 1 2 0]
    Shortest length: 38
    Strange: Length A->B not equal Length B->A


## Generate random distances

There are bonus points for generating random matrices and
computing the corresponding optimal trip. This
could be accomplished with a small auxiliary program to
produce and format the random matrix.

    # Perl weekly challenge 121
    # Task 2: The traveling salesman. Auxiliary program
    #
    # See https://wlmb.github.io/2021/07/12/PWC121/#task-2-the-traveling-salesman
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use v5.12;
    use PDL;
    foreach(@ARGV){
        my $m=random($_,$_);
        $m->diagonal(0,1).=0; # zero the diagonal
        $m= ($m+$m->transpose)/2; #symmetrize (?)
        # Format:
        print "\'[", join(',', map {'['. join(',', @$_).']'} @{unpdl $m}), "]\' ";
    }

I use this program to feed the previous one.

From the timing of the example above we can estimate how long
it would take with this algorithm for an `N=15` or `N=20`
trip, as the time goes with the number possible trips, i.e.,
the number of permutations of `N-1` cities (the first city is
arbitrary but fixed), given by the factorial function
`(N-1)!`. Thus, given that for `N=9` it took about 3s, for
`N=15` it would take about 3s\*14!/8!=6486480s=75 days, and for
`N=20` about three hundred thousand years.


## Simulated annealing

Alternatives to the exhaustive search for an optimum include
using some heuristics or maybe just choosing a random first candidate
and then using a suboptimal but realizable *optimization* such
as *simulated annealing*, which yields good but in general not
optimum solutions. For example, one could use the Monte Carlo method,
permuting two randomly chosen cities, computing the change of
length ΔL, and accepting the new configuration if ΔL≤0, or
accepting it with probability exp(-ΔL/L<sub>0</sub>) if ΔL>0, where L<sub>0</sub>
plays the role of a temperature that is gradually
decreased. In the limit L<sub>0</sub>→0, this procedure would yield a *local
minimum*. The higher the starting value of L<sub>0</sub> and the slower
its decrease, the closer the length of the solution would be
to that of the true optimum.

So it seems that the simple simulated annealing is up to the job. To
understand how the system converges I plot the result vs. the number
of steps using `gnuplot`.

    reset
    set xlabel 'Number of steps'
    set ylabel 'Length'
    set title 'Cities: 9 Sim. annealing factor: 1->0.01'
    unset key
    plot 'rem.txt' u (10*$0):1 every 10 w l

So the simulation seems to be well converged.


## Realistic distances

A problem with the programs above with regards to the
traveling salesman problem is that the random distances are
unrealistic. I would expect any set of distances
computed with any metric, say, the real geometric distance
given by the Euclidean *L<sub>2</sub>* metric or the distance along the
streets of a cuadriculated city given by the *L<sub>1</sub>* norm, to obey
the triangle inequality *d<sub>AB</sub>+d<sub>BC</sub> ≥ d<sub>AC</sub>*. The random
numbers I've been using above violate this inequality in
general. Two cities that are close to a third ought to be
close among themselves. That is not the case for randomly
assigned distances.  Thus, I
rewrite the program above but using randomly
positioned cities and calculating their acutal geometric
distance, using some PDL shorcuts. After initializing the distance
matrix the rest of the program is identical.

In summary, with the *simulated annealing* algorithm presented
above one can search in a few seconds for
good solutions to the traveling salesman problem. For small problems,
the solutions coincided with the truly optimal ones, but that would
not be the case in general. The results depend on the parameters of
the simulation such as the starting and ending temperature and the
rate of cooling. Simulated annealing and other related methods like
*genetic algorithms* or *ant colony optimization* are useful for
obtaining adequate solutions to problems
for which an exhaustive search for an optimum would be prohibitively
expensive, such as the traveling salesman problem.
