# Task 1: Special Positions

    Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar
    You are given a m x n binary matrix.
    
    Write a script to return the number of special positions in the given binary matrix.
    
    A position (i, j) is called special if $matrix[i][j] == 1 and all other elements in
    the row i and column j are 0.
    
    Example 1
    Input: $matrix = [ [1, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 1],
                       [1, 0, 0],
                     ]
    Output: 1
    
    There is only one special position (1, 2) as $matrix[1][2] == 1
    and all other elements in row 1 and column 2 are 0.
    Example 2
    Input: $matrix = [ [1, 0, 0],
                       [0, 1, 0],
                       [0, 0, 1],
                     ]
    Output: 3
    
    Special positions are (0,0), (1, 1) and (2,2).

On a special row the binary `or` of all the bits should be the number 1 (only 0's or
1's, at least one 1) and the sum of all the elements should also be 1
(at most one 1). The same
for a special column. The special positions have the value 1 and are
in a special row and a special column. After building a matrix with
1's only at special positions, I just add them. Using the `Perl Data
Language` (PDL), this may be coded in a two liner:

Example 1:

    perl -MPDL -E '
    $x=pdl(shift);say "$x -> ",(($x)&(($x->borover==1)->dummy(0))&(($x->transpose->borover==1)->dummy(1))
    &(($x->sumover==1)->dummy(0))&(($x->transpose->sumover==1)->dummy(1)))->sum
    ' "[[1 0 0][0 0 1][1 0 0]]"

Results:

    
    [
     [1 0 0]
     [0 0 1]
     [1 0 0]
    ]
     -> 1

Example 2:

    perl -MPDL -E '
    $x=pdl(shift);say "$x -> ",(($x)&(($x->borover==1)->dummy(0))&(($x->transpose->borover==1)->dummy(1))
    &(($x->sumover==1)->dummy(0))&(($x->transpose->sumover==1)->dummy(1)))->sum
    ' "[[1 0 0][0 1 0][0 0 1]]"

Results:

    
    [
     [1 0 0]
     [0 1 0]
     [0 0 1]
    ]
     -> 3

     7  die <<~"FIN" unless @ARGV;
     8      Usage: $0 M1 M2...
     9      where M1, M2... are strings that represent matrices, of the form
    10      "[[m11 m12...][m21 m22...]...]"
    11      FIN
    12  for(@ARGV){
    13      my $x=pdl($_);
    14      say "$x -> ",
    15          (($x) # value is not zero
    16           &(($x->borover==1)->dummy(0)) # only 0's and 1's in row
    17           &(($x->transpose->borover==1)->dummy(1)) # only 0's and 1's in column
    18           &(($x->sumover==1)->dummy(0)) # only one 1 in row
    19           &(($x->transpose->sumover==1)->dummy(1)) # only one 1 in column
    20          )->sum;
    21  }

Examples:

    ./ch-1.pl  "[[1 0 0][0 0 1][1 0 0]]" "[[1 0 0][0 1 0][0 0 1]]"

Results:

    
    [
     [1 0 0]
     [0 0 1]
     [1 0 0]
    ]
     -> 1

# Task 2: Distribute Elements

    You are give an array of integers, @ints and two integers, $x and $y.
    
    Write a script to execute one of the two options:
    
    Level 1:
    Pick an index i of the given array and do $ints[i] += 1
    
    Level 2:
    Pick two different indices i,j and do $ints[i] +=1 and $ints[j] += 1.
    You are allowed to perform as many levels as you want to make every elements
    in the given array equal. There is cost attach for each level, for Level 1,
    the cost is $x and $y for Level 2.
    
    In the end return the minimum cost to get the work done.
    
    Example 1
    Input: @ints = (4, 1), $x = 3 and $y = 2
    Output: 9
    
    Level 1: i=1, so $ints[1] += 1.
    @ints = (4, 2)
    
    Level 1: i=1, so $ints[1] += 1.
    @ints = (4, 3)
    
    Level 1: i=1, so $ints[1] += 1.
    @ints = (4, 4)
    
    We perforned operation Level 1, 3 times.
    So the total cost would be 3 x $x => 3 x 3 => 9
    Example 2
    Input: @ints = (2, 3, 3, 3, 5), $x = 2 and $y = 1
    Output: 6
    
    Level 2: i=0, j=1, so $ints[0] += 1 and $ints[1] += 1
    @ints = (3, 4, 3, 3, 5)
    
    Level 2: i=0, j=2, so $ints[0] += 1 and $ints[2] += 1
    @ints = (4, 4, 4, 3, 5)
    
    Level 2: i=0, j=3, so $ints[0] += 1 and $ints[3] += 1
    @ints = (5, 4, 4, 4, 5)
    
    Level 2: i=1, j=2, so $ints[1] += 1 and $ints[2] += 1
    @ints = (5, 5, 5, 4, 5)
    
    Level 1: i=3, so $ints[3] += 1
    @ints = (5, 5, 5, 5, 5)
    
    We perforned operation Level 1, 1 time and Level 2, 4 times.
    So the total cost would be (1 x $x) + (4 x $y) => (1 x 2) + (4 x 1) => 6

(Note: I corrected a typo in the example above).

The final value of all elements is the maximum of the original
array. If a level 2 is possible, it is preferable unless it is more
expensive than two level 1 steps. I can sort the elements in
descending order, so it is safe to make a level 2 with the remaining
largest and next largest elements as many times as
necessary to make the first element as large as the maximum. It is not
necessary to perform the steps one at a time to calculate the
number of steps and their cost. Then I can shift the array and start over
again until I empty the array. If there are no further elements or if level 2 is too
expensive, I do level 1 steps. I take `$x`, `$y` and `@ints` from
`@ARGV` The result fits a two liner.

Example 1:

    perl -E '
    ($x, $y)=(shift,shift);$t=$y<2*$x;@p=sort{$b<=>$a}@ARGV;$m=shift @p;while(@p){$s=$m-shift @p;
    if($t&&@p){$p[0]+=$s;$c+=$s*$y}else{$c+=$s*$x}} say "x=$x, y=$y, ints= @ARGV -> $c"
    ' 3 2 4 1

Results:

    x=3, y=2, ints= 4 1 -> 9

Example 2:

    perl -E '
    ($x, $y)=(shift,shift);$t=$y<2*$x;@p=sort{$b<=>$a}@ARGV;$m=shift @p;while(@p){$s=$m-shift @p;
    if($t&&@p){$p[0]+=$s;$c+=$s*$y}else{$c+=$s*$x}} say "x=$x, y=$y, ints= @ARGV -> $c"
    ' 2 1 2 3 3 3 5

Results:

    x=2, y=1, ints= 2 3 3 3 5 -> 6
