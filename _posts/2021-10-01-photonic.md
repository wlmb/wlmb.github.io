`Photonic` is a package for the calculation of optical properties of
metamaterials, photonic and plasmonic materials. Version 0.021 has
just been released and is available at [github](https://github.com/wlmb/Photonic) and at [cpan](https://metacpan.org/pod/Photonic). An example
of its use can be read [here](/assets/pdf/20211001triangular.pdf):
macroscopic response of a triangular and a honeycomb lattice of
metallic nanowires.
