# Task 1: Text Justifier

    Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar
    You are given a string and a width.
    
    Write a script to return the string that centers the text within that width
    using asterisks * as padding.
    
    Example 1
    Input: $str = "Hi", $width = 5
    Output: "*Hi**"
    
    Text length = 2, Width = 5
    Need 3 padding characters total
    Left padding: 1 star, Right padding: 2 stars
    
    Example 2
    Input: $str = "Code", $width = 10
    Output: "***Code***"
    
    Text length = 4, Width = 10
    Need 6 padding characters total
    Left padding: 3 stars, Right padding: 3 stars
    
    Example 3
    Input: $str = "Hello", $width = 9
    Output: "**Hello**"
    
    Text length = 5, Width = 9
    Need 4 padding characters total
    Left padding: 2 stars, Right padding: 2 stars
    
    Example 4
    Input: $str = "Perl", $width = 4
    Output: "Perl"
    
    No padding needed
    
    Example 5
    Input: $str = "A", $width = 7
    Output: "***A***"
    
    Text length = 1, Width = 7
    Need 6 padding characters total
    Left padding: 3 stars, Right padding: 3 stars
    
    Example 6
    Input: $str = "", $width = 5
    Output: "*****"
    
    Text length = 0, Width = 5
    Entire output is padding

I find the length of the string, subtract it from the desired width.
and divide by two to get the left padding. The right padding is
whatever is needed to get to the desired width. I use integer
arithmetic to avoid fractional numbers. The result fits a one-liner.

Examples:

    perl -Minteger -E '
    for my($s,$w)(@ARGV){$r=$w-($l=($w-($t=length($s)))/2)-$t;say"$s,$w -> ","*" x $l,$s, "*"x$r}
    ' Hi 5 Code 10 Hello 9 Perl 4 A 7 "" 5

Results:

    Hi,5 -> *Hi**
    Code,10 -> ***Code***
    Hello,9 -> **Hello**
    Perl,4 -> Perl
    A,7 -> ***A***
    ,5 -> *****

The full code is similar, with a couple of checks.

    15          my $length=length $string;
    16          die "Expected a number: $width" unless looks_like_number $width;
    17          die "Width $width is too small for string $string" unless $width>=$length;
    18          $string=~s/^\s*(.*)\s*$/$1/; # Remove leading and trailing spaces
    19          my $left = ($width- $length)/2;
    20          my $right = $width - $left-$length;
    21          say "\"$string\", $width -> ", "*" x $left, $string, "*" x $right;
    22      }
    23      catch($e){warn $e}
    24  }

Examples:

    ./ch-1.pl "Hi" 5 Code 10 Hello 9 Perl 4 A 7 "" 5

Results:

    "Hi", 5 -> *Hi*
    "Code", 10 -> ***Code***
    "Hello", 9 -> **Hello**
    "Perl", 4 -> Perl
    "A", 7 -> ***A***
    "", 5 -> *****


# Task 2: Word Sorter

    Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar
    You are give a sentence.
    
    Write a script to order words in the given sentence alphabetically
    but keeps the words themselves unchanged.
    
    Example 1
    Input: $str = "The quick brown fox"
    Output: "brown fox quick The"
    
    Example 2
    Input: $str = "Hello    World!   How   are you?"
    Output: "are Hello How World! you?"
    
    Example 3
    Input: $str = "Hello"
    Output: "Hello"
    
    Example 4
    Input: $str = "Hello, World! How are you?"
    Output: "are Hello, How World! you?"
    
    Example 5
    Input: $str = "I have 2 apples and 3 bananas!"
    Output: "2 3 and apples bananas! have I"

I split the input strings on space, sort the resulting list ignoring
case and join it back together. I use `sort_by` from `List::UtilsBy`
to sort using lowecase words while keeping the case of the list. The
result fits a one-liner.

Examples:

    perl -MList::UtilsBy=sort_by -E '
    for(@ARGV){@x=split " ";say "$_ -> ", join " ", sort_by{lc}@x}
    ' "The quick brown fox" "Hello    World!   How   are you?" "Hello" \
      "Hello, World! How are you?" "I have 2 apples and 3 bananas!"

Results:

    The quick brown fox -> brown fox quick The
    Hello    World!   How   are you? -> are Hello How World! you?
    Hello -> Hello
    Hello, World! How are you? -> are Hello, How World! you?
    I have 2 apples and 3 bananas! -> 2 3 and apples bananas! have I

    12      my @words=split " ";

    ./ch-2.pl "The quick brown fox" "Hello    World!   How   are you?" "Hello" \
      "Hello, World! How are you?" "I have 2 apples and 3 bananas!"

Results:

    The quick brown fox -> brown fox quick The
    Hello    World!   How   are you? -> are Hello How World! you?
    Hello -> Hello
    Hello, World! How are you? -> are Hello, How World! you?
    I have 2 apples and 3 bananas! -> 2 3 and apples bananas! have I
