I failed to publish this blog in the morning. I received a message I did
not understand about failures to deploy. At first it was a message
about a missing deploy key. Thus, I blindly added a deploy key. The
next failure was related to multiple artifacts named
github-pages. After several attempts to rebuild the pages, I found
some else had a [similar problem](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/111260). I followed the advice, unpublished my
blog, tried to build it again, but no success. FInally, I realized
that my `_config.yml` included the line `version: v1.2.0`. In my laptop
I'm running version 4.3.1, so I replaced that line by `version:
v4.3.1`, pushed the change and the blog came alive again. I don't
fully understand what has happened.
