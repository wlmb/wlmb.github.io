# Task 1: Shortest Distance

    Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
    You are given a string and a character in the given string.
    
    Write a script to return an array of integers of size same as length of the
    given string such that:
    
    distance[i] is the distance from index i to the closest occurence of
    the given character in the given string.
    
    The distance between two indices i and j is abs(i - j).
    Example 1
    Input: $str = "loveleetcode", $char = "e"
    Output: (3,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,2,2,1,0)
    
    The character 'e' appears at indices 3, 5, 6, and 11 (0-indexed).
    The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 0 is at index 3, so the distance
    is abs(0 - 3) = 3.
    The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 1 is at index 3, so the distance
    is abs(1 - 3) = 2.
    For index 4, there is a tie between the 'e' at index 3 and the 'e' at
    index 5, but the distance is still the same: abs(4 - 3) == abs(4 - 5) = 1.
    The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 8 is at index 6, so the distance is
    abs(8 - 6) = 2.
    
    Example 2
    Input: $str = "aaab", $char = "b"
    Output: (3,2,1,0)

This can be solved by making an array of the indices corresponding to
the letter and treat it as the row of a matrix. I take all the indices
corresponding to the string and treat them as a column of another
matrices. I repeat the rows and the columns to make compatible
matrices which I can subtract, take the absolute values, and finally,
I take the minimum values for each row. This may be coded into a
simple two-liner using PDL to manipulate the matrices.

Example 1:

    perl -MPDL -E '
    @a=@ARGV; @x=split "", $a[0]; $i=pdl(grep {$x[$_] eq $a[1]} 0..@x-1);
    $j=sequence(0+@x); say "@a; $a[1] -> ", ($i->dummy(1)-$j->dummy(0))->abs->minover;
    ' loveleetcode e

Results:

    loveleetcode e; e -> [3 2 1 0 1 0 0 1 2 2 1 0]

Example 2:

    perl -MPDL -E '
    @a=@ARGV; @x=split "", $a[0]; $i=pdl(grep {$x[$_] eq $a[1]} 0..@x-1);
    $j=sequence(0+@x); say "@a; $a[1] -> ", ($i->dummy(1)-$j->dummy(0))->abs->minover;
    ' aaab b

Results:

    aaab b; b -> [3 2 1 0]

The full code is similar:

     5  use v5.36;
     6  use PDL;
     7  die <<~"FIN" unless @ARGV==2;
     8      Usage: $0 string letter
     9      to obtain the shortest distances.
    10      FIN
    11  my @letters=split "", $ARGV[0];
    12  my $i=pdl(grep {$letters[$_] eq $ARGV[1]} 0..@letters-1);
    13  my $j=sequence(0+@letters);
    14  say "@ARGV; $ARGV[1] -> ", ($i->dummy(1)-$j->dummy(0))->abs->minover;

Examples:

    ./ch-1.pl loveleetcode e
    ./ch-1.pl aaab b

Results:

    loveleetcode e; e -> [3 2 1 0 1 0 0 1 2 2 1 0]
    aaab b; b -> [3 2 1 0]


# Task 2: Submatrix Sum

    Submitted by: Jorg Sommrey
    You are given a NxM matrix A of integers.
    
    Write a script to construct a (N-1)x(M-1) matrix B having elements
    that are the sum over the 2x2 submatrices of A,
    
    b[i,k] = a[i,k] + a[i,k+1] + a[i+1,k] + a[i+1,k+1]
    
    Example 1
    Input: $a = [
                  [1,  2,  3,  4],
                  [5,  6,  7,  8],
                  [9, 10, 11, 12]
                ]
    
    Output: $b = [
                   [14, 18, 22],
                   [30, 34, 38]
                 ]
    Example 2
    Input: $a = [
                  [1, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 1, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 1, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 1]
                ]
    
    Output: $b = [
                   [2, 1, 0],
                   [1, 2, 1],
                   [0, 1, 2]
                 ]

This is also a good example to show off PDL. The result fits a one and
a half liner.

Example 1:

    perl -MPDL -MPDL::NiceSlice -E '
    $m=pdl(shift); $n=pdl($m(0:-2,0:-2),$m(1:-1,0:-2),$m(0:-2,1:-1),$m(1:-1,1:-1))
    ->mv(-1,0)->sumover; say "$m->$n"
    ' "[[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]]"

Results:

    
    [
     [ 1  2  3  4]
     [ 5  6  7  8]
     [ 9 10 11 12]
    ]
    ->
    [
     [14 18 22]
     [30 34 38]
    ]

Example 2:

    perl -MPDL -MPDL::NiceSlice -E '
    $m=pdl(shift); $n=pdl($m(0:-2,0:-2),$m(1:-1,0:-2),$m(0:-2,1:-1),$m(1:-1,1:-1))
    ->mv(-1,0)->sumover; say "$m->$n"
    ' "[[1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]]"

Results:

    
    [
     [1 0 0 0]
     [0 1 0 0]
     [0 0 1 0]
     [0 0 0 1]
    ]
    ->
    [
     [2 1 0]
     [1 2 1]
     [0 1 2]
    ]

The full code is almost identical.
