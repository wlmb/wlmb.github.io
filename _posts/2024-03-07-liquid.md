{% raw %}
I can escape `liquid` tags I don't want to be interpreted when
generating a blog entry using jekyll by
bracketing the text within
`raw` and `endraw` tags within {% and %} markers. I had to use this
for the *Perl Weekly Challenge 259* which involved solving a problem
related to those markers.
{% endraw %}
