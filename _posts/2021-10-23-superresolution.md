I made an exercise of filtering images trying to beat the Abe
resolution limit. The idea is to apply it to fluorescence microscopy
where the light sources are point-like and spatially separated. I was
able to resolve two gaussianly spread images with width σ when
separated down to 0.6σ.
The detailed notes, theory, codes and results are
